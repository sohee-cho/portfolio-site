        <h3> I am... Sohee Cho. A lover of art, especially in the form of graphic design, music, photography, and dance. Currently a student in Communication Design with aspirations to become a ux/ui designer. Originally from Seoul, South Korea and currently based in Brooklyn, NY. Also, a proud cat-mom. Please feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:sohcho@gmail.com">sohcho@gmail.com</a> for questions, comments, or ideas to collaborate!  </h3>
        
        <h4>I went from wanting to be a teacher, maybe, a performer, then to filmmaker until I found the world where art and technology come together. I would like to build websites and apps that have the best user experience and amazing graphic design. I've loved art in every form possible starting at a very young age. Throughout my life, I painted, sang, danced, took photos, edited and filmed videos, and took interest in many "artsy" and creative hobbies.
        I transferred to City Tech with a goal to grow and become a skilled and talented graphic designer with a focus in Web Design/User Experience. After taking courses Typography 1 and 2, I discovered a newfound interest in typography as well as print design. After graduating, I would like to work with people who desire to make a positive impact in our world and find true joy in it, while being the best at what they do.

        Some of my influences include: Gustav Klimt, Beyonce, <a href="https://riflepaperco.com/" target="_blank">Rifle Paper Co</a>, <a href="http://www.instagram.com/nandotattooer" target="_blank">@nandotattooer</a>, Keith Haring, <a href="http://www.instagram.com/mrdanielhan" target="_blank">@mrdanielhan</a>, and Paula Scher</h4>
